#CSS analysis workflow --> produce HiFi reads from subreads


ccs --version --report-file --log-file subreads.bam ccs.bam

#Iso-Seq workflow


Isoform clustering
FLNC reads are clustered by their sequencing similarity to produce isoform consensus sequences. This step is the last step of 
Iso-Seq analysis if no genome is provided
